# Quizzical App

In this app, the user can test himself depending on custom selections

The app gets the questions from an API called `Open Trivia Database`

## How to interact with the app

1. The user can select the category. There are about 7 categories.
2. He can select the number of questions that must be from 1 : 50
3. He can select the type of the test [ `True / False` or `Multiple Choice` ].
4. Also, he can select the test level [ `Easy` , `Medium` , `Hard` ].
5. Then he can click the `Start quiz` button and start answering the questions.
6. After he answers the questions, he can click the `Check answers` button to reveal the correct answers and his score.

**_Hint_** >> The user won't get the score if he doesn't answer all the questions.

7. After this, he can click the `Play again` button to retry the quiz and get a higher score, or click the `Return to start page` button to return to the start page and custom a new quiz.

The project design is responsive, so enjoy interacting with it on whatever device you use.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
